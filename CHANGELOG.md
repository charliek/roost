# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Releases are
cut with `/release:release vX.Y.Z` — it curates the section below, commits, tags
`vX.Y.Z`, and pushes; the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
builds the DMG + `.deb`s and publishes to the apt repo. Bump
`[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml` to match before tagging (the
release workflow asserts they agree).

## v0.0.2 — 2026-05-26

Programmability + automation release: the command palette and a growing set of
control ops are now driveable over IPC, with an end-to-end test harness
exercising both UIs — plus boot-reliability and Mac↔GTK parity fixes.

### Features

- **Command palette over IPC** — `palette.open` / `state` / `query` /
  `activate` / `dismiss` ops + `roostctl palette …`. Activating a row runs the
  same command its keybind would, so the palette is a scriptable command
  surface, not just UI.
- **`tab.dump`** — read a tab's terminal viewport as text (`roostctl tab dump`),
  the determinism backbone for content assertions.
- **`roostctl wait`** — block until a tab reaches a state / shows text / is
  gone; a no-`sleep` synchronization primitive for scripts and tests.
- **Command launcher** (`Cmd/Alt+Shift+T`), configured via `command =` lines
  (`label` / `run` / `title` / `hold` / `env`), and **Jump to Unread**
  (`Cmd/Alt+Shift+U`) — now on both UIs.
- **`ROOST_CONFIG`** environment variable to read config from an alternate file.

### Fixes

- Boot race: a tab opened via IPC during launch now reliably materializes
  (resync-on-subscribe) instead of never appearing.
- The notification jump + focus-tab now update the *core* active tab, so
  `identify` / `tab.focus` and the restored selection track what's on screen
  (both UIs).
- Mac↔GTK parity: one command-palette command set (`close_project`,
  `jump_to_unread`); Mac `tab.focus` switches the visible tab.

### Tooling & docs

- `tools/roosttest/` — pytest E2E driving a real UI over IPC, headless in CI on
  both platforms; plus the `tools/screenshot/` (visual) and
  `tools/input/linux/` (real-input) harnesses, mapped in `tools/README.md`.
- Reference docs for the IPC ops, CLI, keybindings, and config brought current;
  architecture + principles in `docs/development/vision.md`.

## v0.0.1 — 2026-05-23

First packaged release of Roost — a cross-platform (macOS + Linux) desktop
terminal multiplexer built around libghostty-vt, with multi-project workspaces
and notification routing for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex).

### Features

- Sidebar of projects, tabs per project, one terminal per tab.
- In-process workspace + PTY supervisor + JSON IPC server per UI process — no
  daemon. External tooling (`roostctl`, Claude hooks) talks newline-delimited
  JSON over a Unix-domain socket.
- OSC-driven tab titles, notification banners, and sidebar rollup for agent
  activity.

### Packaging

- macOS: `Roost.app` (Swift + AppKit) shipped as `Roost-0.0.1.dmg`, with the
  `roostctl` CLI embedded under `Contents/Resources/bin/`.
- Linux: GTK4 UI (`roost`) + `roostctl` shipped as `roost_0.0.1_amd64.deb` and
  `roost_0.0.1_arm64.deb`, auto-published to `apt.stridelabs.ai`
  (`sudo apt install roost`).
- The macOS DMG is ad-hoc-signed for now (Developer ID signing + notarization
  land in a follow-up once an Apple Developer account is available). Until then,
  open it via right-click → Open, or
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Roost.app`.
