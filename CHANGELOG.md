# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Releases are
cut with `/release:release vX.Y.Z` — it curates the section below, commits, tags
`vX.Y.Z`, and pushes; the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
builds the DMG + `.deb`s and publishes to the apt repo. Bump
`[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml` to match before tagging (the
release workflow asserts they agree).

## v0.0.1 — 2026-05-23

First packaged release of Roost — a cross-platform (macOS + Linux) desktop
terminal multiplexer built around libghostty-vt, with multi-project workspaces
and notification routing for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex).

### Features

- Sidebar of projects, tabs per project, one terminal per tab.
- In-process workspace + PTY supervisor + JSON IPC server per UI process — no
  daemon. External tooling (`roostctl`, Claude hooks) talks newline-delimited
  JSON over a Unix-domain socket.
- OSC-driven tab titles, notification banners, and sidebar rollup for agent
  activity.

### Packaging

- macOS: `Roost.app` (Swift + AppKit) shipped as `Roost-0.0.1.dmg`, with the
  `roostctl` CLI embedded under `Contents/Resources/bin/`.
- Linux: GTK4 UI (`roost`) + `roostctl` shipped as `roost_0.0.1_amd64.deb` and
  `roost_0.0.1_arm64.deb`, auto-published to `apt.stridelabs.ai`
  (`sudo apt install roost`).
- The macOS DMG is ad-hoc-signed for now (Developer ID signing + notarization
  land in a follow-up once an Apple Developer account is available). Until then,
  open it via right-click → Open, or
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Roost.app`.
